    <title>The Closure of CloudtalkerWhoops</title>

  <body>
    <h1>Hey guys.</h2>
    
    <p>I'm here to announce that CloudtalkerWhoops is officially closed. As a Cloudtalker developer, I felt pretty guilty about CloudtalkerWhoops. When CloudtalkerWhoops was created, it was originally as a 
<a href="https://u.cubeupload.com/Touchcreator/Screenshot2022030315.png">challenge</a>. But seeing how people are trying to continue CloudtalkerWhoops and make it malicious, I have decided to close down the site, and we (Cloudtalker team) have been working our hardest to get CloudtalkerWhoops users out of Cloudtalker. The HTML files have been deleted, and only the source code remains. Thank you, and bye.

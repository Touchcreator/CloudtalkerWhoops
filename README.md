# CloudtalkerWhoops
Exploit software for the Scratch-based social media cloudtalker.
# THIS PROJECT IS NOT BEING WORKED ON ANYMORE, IT MAY COME BACK, HOWEVER, THAT IS VERY UNLIKELY.

## Why so soft?
Cloudtalker already has many vulnerabilities, so the exploits are very light as of now. However, once there starts to be more moderation, I will add more exploits.

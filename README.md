# CloudtalkerWhoops
This is exploit software for the Scratch-based social media cloudtalker.

## Why so soft?
Cloudtalker already has many vulnerabilities, so the exploits are very light as of now. However, once there starts to be more moderation, I will add more exploits.

## Changelog

1.0: Creation

1.1: Custom date changed

1.2: "Random Account" block evasion
